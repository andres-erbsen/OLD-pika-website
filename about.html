	      <p>We are a continuing experiment in cooperative living. We cook together, clean together, and make all house decisions by consensus.

	        <p>pikans call home a 3-story former boarding house, vintage 1910. The house has been continually remodeled and improved since its purchase in 1970 and currently contains 13 doubles and 6 singles, making capacity about 32 people. At the beginning of each term all pikans enter a lottery to choose rooms and roommates. Because of the lottery system, everyone has an equal chance of getting first-pick or last-pick room: there is no seniority.
			</p>
			<p>All of the rooms at pika have unique characteristics from lofts or sleeping closets to window seats, hardwood floors, murals, and porch access. pikans can also choose to make substantial changes to their rooms. That doesn't mean they're allowed to paint the walls, that means they're allowed to MOVE the walls - with the approval of the rest of the house, of course. Each room contains two Ethernet connections for high-speed internet access, and there is wireless access throughout the house.
			</p>
			<p>Other features include a computer room with 4 machines running the MIT operating system, a darkroom, 2 free washers and driers, bicycle storage areas, a television room/library, 2 living rooms, a storage room, extra bicycles for emergency use, a piano, open pantry, a workroom with a wide selection of tools, an industrial size kitchen, a massive dinning room, parking, an herb and vegetable garden, and an intricate series of porches and decks.

	        <p>What is co-operative housing? For one thing, it means that the residents are responsible for maintaining the house. All pikans gather once a week to tidy and clean every part of the house from the dining room to the bathrooms. In addition, each semester we elect a new house manager. There are always two house managers, who are responsible for overseeing house functions and taking care of any problems that might arise.
			</p>
			<p>Being a co-op also means that we have no seniority, and no pledge period. Once you accept a bid at pika, you are a full member, with the same rights and privileges as everyone else. As a member, there are a few requirements in addition to the house duty and kitchen duty. We all participate in four house functions per year: work week, a week at the end of August where we clean and repair the house; work weekend, a weekend in February reserved for cleaning the house; Retreat, a weekend trip to somewhere pretty, also in February, where we discuss issues related to living at pika; and Mini-retreat, a day-long meeting in the fall.
			</p>
			<p>On average, each member contributes 2-4 hours per week to "co-operative living." We think it's a fair trade for a clean house and home-cooked dinners every night of the week.
			</p>
			<p>Our members are generally pretty social, and we like to throw parties and have fun. While we don't place restrictions on anyone's recreational activities, we ask that everyone practice responsibility, respect and safety.
			</p>
			<p>We try to create a safer space at pika through our behavior, speech, and the way we interact with each other. <!--TODO--> Read <a href="#safespace" >our safer space policy</a>.

	        <p>After beginning to coalesce in 1969, pika formally became the Eta Delta chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha (a.k.a. PiKA), an all-male fraternity, in 1970 after successfully petitioning MIT to enter the Inter-Fraternity Council. In 1974, PiKA began asking MIT for permission to go co-ed. The administration rejected the first petition, but in the spring of 1975 it gave PiKA the green light to rush women the next fall.
			</p>
			<p>In 1980 the residents of PiKA decided to leave the national organization; since then, we have been an Independent Living Group (ILG). MIT provided generous financial support by purchasing the house from the PiKA national and refinancing the morgage at a lower interest rate. By 1982 all connections with the national had been severed. We stopped using the names "PiKA" and "Pika", and now refer to ourselves simply as "pika" (all lowercase).
			</p>
			<p>pika has always practiced co-operative living and has generally maintained a female to male ratio of about 1:1, even when MIT did not have this ratio.
			</p>
			<p>In the fall of 2001 pika began accepting graduate students.

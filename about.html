	      <p>We are a continuing experiment in cooperative living. We cook together, clean together, and make all house decisions by consensus.

	        <p>pikans call home a 3-story former boarding house, vintage 1910. The house has been continually remodeled and improved since its purchase in 1970 and currently contains 13 doubles and 7 singles, making capacity about 33 people. At the beginning of each term, pikans fill out a room/roommate preference survey and an ILP algorithm suggests a rooming arrangement. Everyone then meets to discuss adjustments and ensure everyone is satisfied with the final arrangement. There's no seniority, so incoming pikans are just as likely to get their preferred arrangement as old hats. But because of this process, pika does not guarantee singles to any resident.
			</p>
			<p>All of the rooms at pika have unique characteristics from lofts or sleeping closets to window seats, hardwood floors, murals, and porch access. pikans can also choose to make substantial changes to their rooms. That doesn't mean they're allowed to paint the walls, that means they're allowed to MOVE the walls - with the approval of the rest of the house, of course. Each room contains two Ethernet connections for high-speed (gigabit) internet access, and there is wireless access throughout the house.
			</p>
			<p>Other features include a computer/study room, a darkroom, 2 free washers and driers, bicycle storage areas, a television room/library, 2 living rooms, a storage room, extra bicycles for emergency use, a piano, open pantry, a workroom with a wide selection of tools, an industrial kitchen, a massive dinning room, parking, an herb and vegetable garden, and an intricate series of porches and decks.

	        <p>What is co-operative housing? For one thing, it means that the residents are responsible for maintaining the house. All pikans gather once a week to tidy and clean every part of the house from the dining room to the bathrooms (we call this "Sunday House Improvement Time-Space", or "SHITS"). In addition, each semester we elect a new house manager. There are always two house managers, who are responsible for overseeing house functions and taking care of any problems that might arise.
			</p>
			<p>Being a co-op also means that we have no seniority, and no pledge period. Once you accept a bid at pika, you are a full member, with the same rights and privileges as everyone else. As a member, there are a few requirements in addition to the house duty and kitchen duty. We all participate in four house functions per year: work week, a week at the end of August where we clean and repair the house; work weekend, a weekend in February reserved for cleaning the house and doing bite-sized home-improvement projects; and retreat, a weekend trip to somewhere pretty, where we discuss issues related to living at pika; and Mini-retreat, a day-long meeting in the fall.
			</p>
			<p>On average, each member contributes 2-4 hours per week to "co-operative living", through some combination of SHITS, mealplan cooking/cleaning, and elected positions (e.g. house manager, treasurer).
			</p>
			<p>
      pika occasionally throws large-scale social events (about once or twice per semester), although residents have small gatherings of friends and housemates much more often. It's common (and encouraged) for pikans to "lure" social or study groups to pika with the promise of free food and/or extra friends.

	        <p>After beginning to coalesce in 1969, pika formally became the Eta Delta chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha (a.k.a. PiKA), an all-male fraternity, in 1970 after successfully petitioning MIT to enter the Inter-Fraternity Council. In 1974, PiKA began asking MIT for permission to go co-ed. The administration rejected the first petition, but in the spring of 1975 it gave PiKA the green light to rush women the next fall.
			</p>
			<p>In 1980 the residents of PiKA decided to leave the national organization; since then, we have been an Independent Living Group (ILG). MIT provided generous financial support by purchasing the house from the PiKA national and refinancing the morgage at a lower interest rate. By 1982 all connections with the national had been severed. We stopped using the names "PiKA" and "Pika", and now refer to ourselves simply as "pika" (all lowercase, even at the beginning of sentences).
			</p>
			<p>pika has always practiced co-operative living and has generally maintained a female to male ratio of about 1:1, even when MIT did not have this ratio.
			</p>
			<p>In the fall of 2001 pika began accepting graduate students, although we still give priority to undergraduates.

      <h1>Basement</h1>
      <h2 id="Laundry">Laundry</h2>
      <p>
      Free laundry! 2 washers, 2 driers.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Reuse">Reuse</h2>
      <p>
      "Reuse" is MIT jargon for stuff that, rather than having been thrown away, was put in a designated place for other people to pick over. We keep our own, which contains mostly clothing but occasionally tech/tools/outdoor supplies/random other stuff.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Cave">Cave</h2>
      <p>
      Study room that's good for quiet work in isolation from the usual buzz of activity.
      </p> 
      <h2 id="Printers">Textbooks/Printers</h2>
      <p>
      We have printers. We also have a "textbook library", where pikans put their used textbooks for others to access.
      </p> 
      <h2 id="Pantry">Pantry</h2>
      <p>
      We store surplus non-perishable food in this walk-in pantry. Once, many years ago, we had an issue with people leaving the door to the rice/pasta/cereal storage open, and some rodents got in. To fix this, a system was installed such that if you leave the door open for too long, a red light flashed and a casette player starts telling you to close the door in a strange, half-pleading half-irritated tone.
      </p> 
      <h2 id="Burrow">Burrow</h2>
      <p>
      Tiny study room with a desk and a chair, and not much else.
      </p> 
      <h2 id="TV Room">TV Room</h2>
      <p>
      Sometimes we gather to watch movies and TV here. It also stores most of our board game collection, and several shelves of books.
      </p> 
      <h2 id="Label Your Shit">Label Your Shit</h2>
      <p>
      This is the storage room where residents can put their stuff. There's one rule--can you guess what it is?
      </p>
      <h2 id="Shop">Shop</h2>
      <p>
      We have a nicely-stocked machine shop, suitable for smallish projects or bike repair.
      </p>

      <h1>First (Ground) Floor</h1>
      <h2 id="Murph">Murph</h2>
      <p> The heart of pika, where everyone gathers for house meetings, casual hangouts, and jam sessions.</p>

      <p> The second heart of pika, where everyone gathers to eat and talk.</p>
      <h2 id="Kitchen">Kitchen</h2>
      <p> Our massive industrial kitchen, complete with all the spices one could ever want.</p>
      <h2 id="Sex Dungeon">Sex Dungeon</h2>
      <p> Not actually a sex dungeon--this is just our kitchen counter. There are a few stories about the name. One goes that we put up a camera so people could see a live feed of what was being served for dinner, and thought it would be hilarious to put this feed at a URL with "sex dungeon" in it, so that if people were for some reason looking for an MIT sex dungeon, they would just find us serving each other food. We still find it pretty hilarious to send out emails like "Vegan chocolate-chip cookies on the sex dungeon! Come and get them!" </p>
      <h2 id="Jazz Lounge">Jazz Lounge</h2>
      <p> A bunch of couches next to the dining room that's often a nice place for socializing. There are a bunch of abstract paintings on the walls, but no one is really sure how they got there. </p>

      <p><strong>Name:</strong>A tiny single originally named &quot;the coffin&quot; for the coffin-like cubby where residents often put their bed. Most of this room used to be wasted space under the roof. Then one day, a pikan who had scored low in the singles lottery asked the house if he were to create a new single, could he live in it? When they agreed, he knocked down the walls of a small third floor closet and recovered the lost space into a really cool room. More recently, a pikan installed a skylight during work week, and got everyone to call it &quot;the skylight&quot;.</p>
